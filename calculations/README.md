# Calculation Approach
The Energy Intensity Indicators are a series of log mean divisia index (LMDI) decompositions implemented hierarchically.

Each LDMI hierarchy level uses shared calculations, performed on activity and energy data of that level.

## Shared Calculations
These are the
### Energy Data
* Energy Shares
    * Log-Mean Divisia Weights

### Activity Data


### Final LDMI
* Activity index
* Index of
