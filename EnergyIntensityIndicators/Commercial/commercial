        generally follow the same trends as population or housing units. Here residential estimates of residential housing units
        were used to reflect these overall trends. 
        -For each region, a simple regression model was estimated between the regional housing unit share and the regional commmercial
        building floor space share from the NBECS/CBECS. The regression employed both shares in log form. Based on the estimated 
        coefficients from this regression, the annual housing unit values are used to predict the share of commercial floor space 
        in each region. The normalized shares of floorspace by census region (normalized to sum to 1) are contained in Regional_Floorspace
