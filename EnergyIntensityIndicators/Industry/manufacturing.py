# Table 3.1 and 3.2 (MECS total fuel consumption)  Table 3.1 shows energy
# consumption by fuel in physical units, including the total across all fuels expressed in trillion Btu and
# electricity in kWh. From Table 3.1, total fuel consumption in Btu can be calculated as difference between
# total energy and electricity consumption after conversion to Btu. Table 3.2 only differs from Table 3.1 by
# showing all fuel types in Btu.

# For 2014, the values for total energy consumption and electricity consumption, both defined in terms of
# trillion Btu, from Table 3.2 are transferred to spreadsheet ind_hap3. Worksheet MECS_Fuel in this
# spreadsheet has been used to collect the fuel consumption estimates for all the MECS dating back to the
# first MECS in 1985. The 2014 data are located in the cell range F218:F238.
# The first six NAICS sectors are aggregated into three sectors (311-312, 313-314, and 315-316) as a part
# of the set of manufacturing indicators. The energy consumption data under this revised sectoring
# classification are shown in the columns to the right, columns O and P.
